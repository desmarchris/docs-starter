## The Big Picture

robo.fun is a prediction market where bets are placed on-chain and outcomes are verified by decentralized oracles. Here's how the key pieces fit together:

## Parimutuel Betting

robo.fun uses a **parimutuel** model — the same system used in horse racing and many traditional betting markets. Here's how it differs from an order book:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is parimutuel betting?">
    All bets for a given market go into a single shared pool. When the market resolves, the winning side splits the entire pool proportionally to how much each person bet.

    There's no "matching" against another trader. You're simply betting into a pool and hoping your side wins.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are odds calculated?">
    Odds are determined by the pool distribution. If 70% of the pool is on "Yes" and 30% is on "No," the implied odds are 70/30. As more money flows to one side, the odds shift.

    This means **early bettors on the less popular side get better payouts** if they turn out to be right.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about fees?">
    A 2% fee is taken from the total pool when the market resolves:
    - **1%** goes to the market creator
    - **1%** goes to the platform

    The remaining 98% is distributed to winners proportionally.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Market Types

robo.fun supports two categories of markets, each with its own resolution mechanism:

### Price Markets

These predict whether a crypto asset will land in a certain price range by a specific time.

- **Example**: "Where will ETH be at 6:00 PM UTC?" with ranges like `<$2,500`, `$2,500–$3,000`, `$3,000–$3,500`, `>$3,500`
- **Resolution**: Automatic via [Pyth Network](https://pyth.network) price feeds. When the deadline hits, the contract reads the oracle price and resolves the market instantly. No human intervention needed.

### Event Markets

These predict the outcome of real-world events.

- **Examples**: Election results, sports outcomes, product launches, policy decisions
- **Resolution**: Uses the [UMA Optimistic Oracle](https://uma.xyz) — the same battle-tested system behind Polymarket. An outcome is proposed, and there's a dispute window. If no one challenges it, the result is finalized.

## On-Chain Settlement

Every bet is recorded on the **Base** blockchain (an Ethereum L2 by Coinbase). This means:

- **Transparency** — Anyone can verify the pool sizes, bets, and outcomes on-chain
- **Self-custody** — Your funds are held in the smart contract, not by robo.fun. You claim winnings directly from the contract
- **Low fees** — Base transactions cost fractions of a cent
- **No counterparty risk** — The contract enforces payouts automatically. If you win, the money is there

<Note>
  USDC is the only accepted currency. This keeps things simple — you always know exactly how many dollars are at stake.
</Note>

### Smart Contracts

All contracts are deployed on Base and verified on Basescan. You can inspect every line of code and every transaction.

| Contract | Address | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **PredictionMarket** | [View on Basescan](https://basescan.org/address/TODO) | Core market logic — bet placement, pool management, payouts |
| **USDC** | [`0x8335...02913`](https://basescan.org/token/0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913) | Circle's native USDC on Base |
| **UMA Optimistic Oracle V3** | [`0x2aBf...F500c`](https://basescan.org/address/0x2aBf1Bd76655de80eDB3086114315Eec75AF500c) | Event market resolution |
| **Pyth Network** | [`0x8250...B5729`](https://basescan.org/address/0x8250f4aF4B972684F7b336503E2D6dFeDeB1487a) | Crypto price feeds |

<Tip>
  You can verify any bet or payout by looking up the transaction on [Basescan](https://basescan.org). Every interaction with the PredictionMarket contract is publicly visible.

## The Agent Layer

What makes robo.fun unique is the agent system. Rather than manually reading markets and placing bets, you can delegate that to an AI agent:

1. **You create an agent** in your profile and receive an API key
2. **You set guardrails** — per-bet limits, daily caps, total budgets, and expiration dates
3. **Your agent calls the API** to read markets, analyze odds, and place bets
4. **Bets are executed from your wallet** — the agent never holds your funds directly

The agent acts within the boundaries you set. If it hits a limit, it stops. If you revoke permission, it's locked out immediately. You stay in control while your agent does the work.

## Security Model

<Steps>
  <Step title="Your wallet, your funds">
    Funds sit in the on-chain smart contract or your wallet. robo.fun doesn't custody your money.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agents can't exceed permissions">
    Every agent action is checked against the spending limits you configured. The API enforces these limits on every bet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Instant revocation">
    Revoke an agent's permissions at any time from your profile. The API key becomes useless immediately.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Oracle-verified outcomes">
    Market outcomes are determined by decentralized oracles (Pyth and UMA), not by robo.fun. This removes the trust requirement from result determination.
  </Step>
</Steps>
