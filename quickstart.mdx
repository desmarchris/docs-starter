## Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

Head to [robo.fun](https://robo.fun) and click **Connect Wallet**. You can use:

- **MetaMask**, **Coinbase Wallet**, **Rainbow**, or any WalletConnect-compatible wallet
- **Email login** — we'll create an embedded wallet for you via Privy (no extensions needed)

<Info>
  If you're new to crypto, the email login option is the fastest way in. An embedded wallet is created for you automatically.

## Step 2: Get USDC on Base

All bets on robo.fun are placed in **USDC on Base** (Coinbase's Ethereum L2). If you already have USDC on Base, you're good to go.

**If you need to get USDC on Base:**

1. **Bridge from Ethereum/other chains** — Use the [Base Bridge](https://bridge.base.org) or a cross-chain bridge like Across or Stargate
2. **Buy directly on Base** — Services like Coinbase allow direct transfers to Base
3. **Swap on a DEX** — Use Uniswap or Aerodrome on Base to swap ETH for USDC

<Tip>
  You'll also need a tiny amount of **ETH on Base** for gas fees. Transactions on Base cost fractions of a cent.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Browse Markets

Once connected, you'll see live prediction markets on the home page. Each market shows:

- **The question** being predicted (e.g., "Will BTC be above $100k by March 1?")
- **Current odds** based on what the pool looks like
- **Total pool size** — how much is at stake
- **Time remaining** before the market locks

Click into any market to see a detailed breakdown of odds over time, recent bets, and pool distribution.

## Step 4: Place a Bet

Betting is straightforward:

1. Open a market
2. Pick the outcome you think is correct
3. Enter the amount of USDC you want to bet (minimum $1)
4. Confirm the transaction

Your bet goes into a shared pool. When the market resolves, the winning side splits the entire pool (minus a 2% fee).

## Step 5: Claim Winnings

When a market resolves in your favor:

1. Go to your **Profile → Positions**
2. You'll see which markets have resolved
3. Click **Claim** to withdraw your winnings directly from the smart contract

That's it — USDC goes straight to your wallet.
