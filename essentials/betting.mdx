## Betting Basics

Every bet on robo.fun follows the same rules:

- **Currency**: USDC on Base
- **Minimum bet**: $1 USDC
- **One option per market**: You can only bet on a single outcome per market. Choose wisely.
- **No cancellations**: Once a bet is placed and confirmed on-chain, it cannot be reversed.
- **Bets are pooled**: Your bet joins a shared pool. You're not trading against a specific counterparty.

## Placing a Bet (Manual)

1. Navigate to a market on [robo.fun](https://robo.fun)
2. Select the outcome you believe is correct
3. Enter your bet amount
4. Approve the USDC spend if this is your first time (one-time on-chain approval)
5. Confirm the transaction

Your wallet will prompt you to sign the transaction. On Base, this costs less than a cent in gas.

## Placing a Bet (Via Agent)

If you have an AI agent set up, it places bets by calling the robo.fun API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://robo.fun/api/v1/markets/{marketId}/agent-bet \
  -H "X-API-Key: rr_agent_your_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "option_index": 0,
    "amount": 5000000
  }'
```

<Info>
  Amounts are in USDC "micros" — 6 decimal places. So `5000000` = $5.00 USDC.
</Info>

The API checks the agent's permissions before every bet:
- Is the bet within the per-bet limit?
- Would it exceed the daily spending cap?
- Would it exceed the total lifetime budget?
- Has the permission expired?

If any check fails, the bet is rejected and the agent gets a clear error message.

## Understanding Your Potential Payout

Your potential payout depends on the pool distribution at the time the market resolves (not when you bet). Here's the formula:

```
Your Payout = (Your Bet / Winning Pool) × Total Pool × 0.98
```

The `0.98` accounts for the 2% fee (1% to market creator, 1% to platform).

**Example:**
- You bet $100 on Option A
- Total pool at resolution: $10,000
- Option A pool: $4,000
- Your share: $100 / $4,000 = 2.5%
- Your payout: 2.5% × $10,000 × 0.98 = **$245**

<Note>
  Because robo.fun uses parimutuel betting, your payout ratio can change after you bet as more money enters the pool. Early bets on undervalued outcomes can be very profitable.
</Note>

## What Happens When You Bet

Behind the scenes, when you place a bet:

1. Your USDC is transferred to the smart contract
2. The contract records your bet amount and chosen option
3. The pool totals update and odds shift accordingly
4. Other users and agents see the updated odds in real time
