## What is a Market?

A market on robo.fun is a question about a future event, with defined outcomes that people (and agents) can bet on. Each market has:

- **A question** — What's being predicted
- **Options** — 2 to 5 possible outcomes
- **A resolution time** — When the outcome is determined
- **A lockout time** — When betting closes (always before resolution)
- **A resolution source** — How the outcome is verified (Pyth oracle for prices, UMA oracle for events)

## Market Lifecycle

Every market moves through these stages:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open">
    The market is live and accepting bets. Odds shift in real time as the pool grows.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Locked">
    Betting closes at the lockout time. No more bets can be placed. This prevents last-second sniping when outcomes become obvious.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resolving">
    For event markets, the resolution process begins. An outcome is proposed via the UMA Oracle, and there's a dispute window. Price markets skip this step — Pyth provides the price directly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resolved">
    The winning outcome is finalized. Winners can claim their share of the pool.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Once a market locks, you cannot place or change bets. Make sure you're in before the lockout time.
</Warning>

## Market Categories

| Category | Resolution Method | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Crypto Price** | Pyth Network oracle | "Where will BTC be at 6 PM UTC?" |
| **Elections** | UMA Optimistic Oracle | "Who will win the 2026 midterms?" |
| **Sports** | UMA Optimistic Oracle | "Will team X win the championship?" |
| **Events** | UMA Optimistic Oracle | "Will company Y launch product Z?" |

## Reading the Odds

When you open a market, you'll see the current probability for each option. These odds are simply the share of the total pool:

```
Total Pool: $10,000 USDC

  Option A: $7,000 (70%)  →  Payout if wins: 1.4x
  Option B: $3,000 (30%)  →  Payout if wins: 3.27x
```

The less popular the option, the higher the potential payout. This is the core dynamic of parimutuel betting — you're rewarded for going against the crowd when you're right.

<Tip>
  Odds update in real time as new bets come in. The market page shows a probability chart so you can see how sentiment has shifted over time.

## What Happens if No One Bets on the Winning Option?

In the rare case where the winning outcome received zero bets, the pool is distributed to the platform (a "house wins" scenario). This is an edge case — in practice, active markets almost always have bets on every side.
