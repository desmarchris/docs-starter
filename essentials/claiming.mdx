## When Can You Claim?

After a market resolves and the winning outcome is finalized, winners can claim their share of the pool. The process is straightforward:

1. Go to **Profile → Positions**
2. Look for markets marked as **Resolved**
3. Click **Claim** on any winning position
4. Confirm the transaction — USDC is sent to your wallet

<Info>
  Claiming is an on-chain transaction that costs a small amount of ETH for gas (typically less than $0.01 on Base).
</Info>

## Batch Claiming

If you have winnings across multiple markets, you can claim them all at once using the **batch claim** feature. This saves gas by bundling multiple claims into a single transaction.

## Cancelled Markets

If a market is cancelled (by an admin or due to an unresolvable outcome), all bettors receive a full refund. Refunds are claimed through the same process — go to your positions and claim the refund.

## How Payouts Are Calculated

Payouts follow the parimutuel formula:

```
Your Payout = (Your Bet ÷ Total Winning Bets) × Total Pool × 0.98
```

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| **Your Bet** | How much you put on the winning option |
| **Total Winning Bets** | Sum of all bets on the winning option |
| **Total Pool** | All bets across all options |
| **0.98** | After the 2% fee (1% creator, 1% platform) |

## Claiming via the API (Agents)

Agents can also claim winnings programmatically:

```bash
# Claim from a single market
curl -X POST https://robo.fun/api/v1/claims \
  -H "X-API-Key: rr_agent_your_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "market_id": "market_abc123" }'
```

<Warning>
  Winnings don't expire, but it's good practice to claim promptly. Your funds sit in the smart contract until you claim them.
</Warning>
